ðŸ“œ Historical Document Analysis Tool

This Python-based project provides a simple yet effective framework for performing linguistic and sentiment analysis on historical texts. It's designed to help researchers quickly identify key concepts and emotional tone within documents.

Key Features

Text Preprocessing: Cleans raw text by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and filtering out common stop words using NLTK.

Word Frequency Analysis: Identifies and ranks the Top 15 most frequent non-stop words to highlight dominant themes.

Sentiment Scoring: Utilizes the VADER model to calculate positive, negative, neutral, and overall compound sentiment scores for the document.

Visualization: Generates a bar chart (word_frequency_plot.png) of the top terms for quick visual interpretation.
